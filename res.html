During India's chase, former captain Virat Kohli was involved in a DRS incident in the 15th over of the innings. In the final ball, Kohli looked to work the offbreak from Akila Dananjaya down the leg side off the back foot, but the ball beat the inside edge and struck his pads. The home team broke into a loud appeal, and the umpire did not hesitate to concur as he raised his finger. But Kohli opted for a review, and the UltraEdge showed that there was a spike when the ball was close to the bat, which was enough for TV umpire Wilson to overturn the call.
